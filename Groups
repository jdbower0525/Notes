Ashley
	Good Reads = Complete redesign of goodreads personal bookshelf…  multiple navbars, pulling images and having pullovers for single page html.  
	mouseover & hover, search functions populating by what they’ve read and what full lists.  A lot of movie lens type.
	solid amounts of hard coding, SASS, nested version of style sheets.  Pre-processed style sheets.  Almost like a backend stylesheet (css version of handlebars)
	not using mouseover data, any data associated with the page isn’t stored.  
	heavy single page pagination
	if/else in javascript
	static images from local host

Lina

Eloisa
    BranchlessBank - visuals for a mobile app, depositing a check using a mobile app.
	login html, no interaction with databases or authentication/authorization.
	apps made through invisionapp.com, automatic pagination through images/html/css without any buttonn.click() styles.
	no code, step through and framework for a project, hotspots on the website aren’t full functionality buttons but shows a little interaction without the code.
	proof of concept
