‘Make sure that you do this’
Inheritance is not used as much
1 object, 1 purpose
interconnectedness is often too complex


TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
Red - Write a test that doesn’t pass
      Run the test (to watch it fail)

Green - Write code to pass the test
	Run the test (to watch it pass)

Refactor - Remove duplicate code
	    Reduce complexity
	    Improve code
	    Push to github

__init__ is a constructor
__init__ is the function that is called when you create a new instance of the class

Class being the blueprint
Instances being the objects created using the blueprint

class Test:
	def do_something(self):
		print(“I did something”)
>>> t = Test()
>>> t.do_something()
I did something


__eq__
a == b
a.__eq__(b)


od = Currency(‘USD’, 1)
od.known_currency_symbols
>>> prints dict

od.known_currency_symbols[‘just for fun’] = ‘now watch this’
