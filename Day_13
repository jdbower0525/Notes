HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS

Lambda:
def print_dictionary_sorted_by_value(d):
	for key, value in sorted(d.items(), key = lambda x: x[1][-1])
		print(key, value)

Map:
times_two = lambda x: x* 2
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
numbers_times_two = map(times_two, numbers)
list(numbers_times_two)

Filter:
fibs = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55]
odd_fibs = filter(lambda x: x % 2, fibs)
even_fibs = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, fibs)

Reduce:
reduce(lambda x, y: x+y [47, 11, 42, 13]
47 11
58 42
100 13
